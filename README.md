Cron

The original game can be played on http://blackscorp.github.io/cron/
It seems this game originally was a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up like [1942](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942_(video_game)).

Instructions
============

Arrow keys to move
Space to shoot


Why I do this?
==============

I have loved playing games since I was a child and I have never developed a game... so it is time to try it. Just for fun!
